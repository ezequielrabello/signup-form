# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

## Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ’» About the project

This challenge was about building out a sign-up form and getting it looking as close to the design as possible above.
Also, as you can see in the picture above, the project required validations for all inputs on the form.

## ðŸ›  Technologies 
This project was developed with the following technologies:
- ### Javascript
  â–¶ On JS, I was able to practice querySeletor and querySelectorAll and its behavior on the code in general. Also, I learned a new code that automatically checks if what the user typed is an e-mail or not. 
- ### HTML
  â–¶ On HTML, I was able to organize my code and anticipate myself for future ideas that might have shown up during coding. 
- ### CSS
  â–¶ On CSS, It was possible to practice more concepts about @media() and improve my responsive layout skills.
